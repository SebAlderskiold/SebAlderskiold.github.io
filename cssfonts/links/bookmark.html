        <strong id = "What">What</strong> if dogs were racist? Would they care about fur color….. 
        “son, only play with other tan dogs”? Or maybe it would depend on breed, 
        “honey, only play with other German Shepards, never poodles”. 
        Better yet it could depend on occupation. “I’m a sled dog while you’re only a running companion, 
        leave me alone”. Maybe the neighborhood they live in could be the way they choose which dogs to associate with and which to shun?
        Size could be the determining factor, “see how tall that dog is, they are probably dumb”. Luckily dogs don’t discriminate. 
        Just watch at a dog park. Big black and white dogs wag their tails and play with tiny tan dogs. 
        A service dog chases after the same ball as the off-duty police dog. So if dogs don’t discriminate then why do we?

        <strong id = "It">It </strong> really shouldn't have mattered to Betty. 
        That's what she kept trying to convince herself even if she knew it mattered to Betty more than practically anything else. 
        Why was she trying to convince herself otherwise? As she stepped forward to knock on Betty's door, 
        she still didn't have a convincing answer to this question that she'd been asking herself for more than two years now.

        <strong id = "Mary">Mary </strong> had to make a decision and she knew that whatever decision she made, 
        it would upset someone. It seemed like such a silly reason for people to get upset 
        but she knew the minute that she began to consider doing it that there was no way everyone in her life would be pleased 
        with what she ultimately decided to do. It was simply a question of who she would rather displease most. 
        While this had always been her parents, and especially her mom, in the past that she tried to keep from upsetting, 
        she decided that this time the person she was going to please the most with her decision was herself.
